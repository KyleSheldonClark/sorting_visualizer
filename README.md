Sorting Visualizer
==================

Bubble Sort
------------
- Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list. Comparing adjacent elements and swaps the elements if they are in the incorrect order. Bubble Sort is a comparison sort algorithm meaning it only reads list elements through a single comparison operation.

- Bubble Sort has a worst case and average complexity of O(n^2) where n is the number of items being sorted.

Quicksort
----------
- Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. A pivot is selected from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays with smaller values than the pivot in one sub-array and values that are greater in another. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

- Quicksort has a worst case complexity of O(n^2) and a best case of O(n log n).

Marge Sort
-----------
- Merge Sort is also a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. A given input array is divided in two halves, then the algorithm calls itself for both halves, and merges the two sorted halves. The merge operation is a key process that assumes both given arrays are sorted and merges the two sub-arrays into one.

------------
- Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list. Comparing adjacent elements and swaps the elements if they are in the incorrect order. Bubble Sort is a comparison sort algorithm meaning it only reads list elements through a single comparison operation.

- Bubble Sort has a worst case and average complexity of O(n^2) where n is the number of items being sorted.
